plugin.video.filmovizija
========================

My test filmovizija.com plugin for xbmc/prismcube...

A really simple, test plugin for streaming content from filmovizija.com, this is a learning project for me and some bugs can be expected...

Some parts of code are reused from other projects found on google or github, some slightly modified...


Install: 

- use download as zip option on this webpage or clone using git
- manualy install to xbmc using install zip option http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Add-on_manager#How_to_install_from_a_ZIP_file


PS: one of video hosts used by filmovizija is vk.com, you will need to register for a free account there and add your login details in plugin settings.
